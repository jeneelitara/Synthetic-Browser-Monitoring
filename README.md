# IAMOps Synthetic Browser Monitoring

A Playwright-based synthetic monitoring tool for testing website accessibility and basic functionality across multiple pages.

## Overview

This project performs automated browser-based monitoring of the IAMOps website, checking that all critical pages load successfully and meet basic accessibility criteria. It uses Playwright to simulate real browser interactions and validate page health.

## Features

- **Automated Page Testing**: Tests multiple predefined paths on the website
- **HTTP Status Validation**: Ensures all pages return successful HTTP status codes (< 400)
- **Browser-Level Checks**: Verifies pages load properly in the browser
- **Content Sanity Checks**: Validates page titles and basic content presence
- **Headed/Headless Modes**: Support for both visual and automated testing modes
